Radiation Interactions
======================
There are several major kinds of radiation which interact with matter, represented in the table below.

|             Charged Particulate Radiations            	|                  Uncharged Radiations                 	|
|:-----------------------------------------------------:	|:-----------------------------------------------------:	|
| Heavy charged particles $\sim10^{-5}\operatorname{m}$ 	|         Neutrons $\sim10^{-1}\operatorname{m}$        	|
| Fast electrons $\sim10^{-3}\operatorname{m}$          	| X-rays \& $\gamma$ rays $\sim10^{-1}\operatorname{m}$ 	|

As can be seen from the table, charged radiation has a typically shorter interaction distance than that of the uncharged variety. Charged radiation interacts _continuously_ with the medium through the Coulomb force, whereas uncharged radiation must first undergo a series of discrete interactions such as collisions.

Heavy Charged Particles
-----------------------
Heavy charged particles such as the $\alpha$ interact primarily through the coulomb force between the particles and orbital electrons within the absorber atoms. Direct interactions between the particles and nuclei _are possible_, though quite unlikely, and are usually insignificant in their effect upon the detector response.

Through the Coulomb force, the passage of a charged particle within an absorbing medium will apply an _impulse_ to the surrounding electrons. Depending upon the proximity of the encounter, the impulse may be sufficient to raise an electron to a higher energy level within the atom (_excitation_), or to remove it from the atom completely (_ionisation_).

<!-- TODO: If not excited, how much E is transferred, and how is it dissipated? -->
When treated as an [elastic collision](../mechanics/2D-collisions.md#Energy-Transfer), the maximum energy transfer from a charged particle of mass $m$ with kinetic energy $E$ to a static electron of mass $m_0$ is $\frac{4Em_0}{m}$. This value is so small that the primary particle must lose its energy through numerous repeated interactions during its passage through a material.
