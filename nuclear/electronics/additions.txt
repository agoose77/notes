DETECTOR
Bias resistance to block current flow to HV
Pull down resistance to block current flow to gnd
Capacitance leads to noise accumulation - cable capacitance from double-wire config
Pre-Aamp close to detector to reduce noise degredation on signal
Amp further away on line signal
PREAMP:
Input resistor in inverting is chosen for impedence matching.
Rise time 10ns-100ns for silicon
Voltage of output signal kept small to prevent crosstalk.

SHAPING:
Smooths peak to reduce time variance sensitivity of sharp peak.

SUCC-APPROX:
SAMPLE & HOLD - mirror signal until peak (where we hold)
Find peak via zero crossing of derivative
Typically ADCs have 10V dynamic rane.
