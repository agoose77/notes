Germaniums slow ~5ns vs 1ns scintillators
Small Z so low efficiency
Doppler shift in flight
Doppler broadening from uncertainties

Silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor - require momentum and energy change for lowest $1.1\eV$ band gap quoted.

Germanium especially favourable due to low [hole mass](https://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/effmass.htm) (effective mass from $k(p)$ vs $E$ parabolic fit)
