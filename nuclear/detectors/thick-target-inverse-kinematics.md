Thick Target Inverse Kinematics (TTIK)
======================================
The TTIK technique is used to perform continuous measurement of an _excitation function_ using a single, fixed beam energy.

The experimental setup involves a thick target volume (usually a gas), where *thick* implies that the beam is fully stopped within the target. In the above figure, an He gas target is used, with which surrounds the experimental equipment. 

The beam energy spans a continuous range, with the maximum defined at the point following the entry window, and the minimum limited only by the scattering process. In order to reach the detectors, the detected particles must have a lower stopping power than the beam nuclei. The term *inverse kinematics* refers to a beam with heavier nuclei than those of the target. In this configuration, the scattered light particles are confined to a cone of forward angles in the laboratory frame (for elastic scattering, see [the deflection angle in 2D scattering](../../mechanics/2D-non-relativistic-collisions.md#Deflection-Angle), which approaches zero as the beam to mass ratio increases), which allows for the detectors to placed solely at forward angles.
