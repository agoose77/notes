Reactions
=========

Nuclear reactions are typically written in the form $X(a,b)Y$, which is effectively shorthand for $a+X\rightarrow Y+b$, where $a$ is the projectile, $X$ the target, and $b,Y$ the products.

N.b. let $m_X$ be the _rest mass_ of $X$.

Q Value
-------
In any reaction, the total energy is conserved, i.e.
$$
\tag{a}
T_a + m_ac^2 + T_X + m_Xc^2 = T_b + m_bc^2 + T_Y + m_Yc^2\,.
$$
The Q value of the reaction is simply the change in mass energy
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tag{b}
Q &= \bqty{m_a+m_X-m_b-m_Y}c^2\\
&= T_b+T_Y - T_a-T_X\,.
\end{aligned}
$$
For reactions which produce *excited* nuclei, i.e. $X(a,b)Y^â­‘$, the Q value $Q^*$ for these reactions becomes
$$
\begin{aligned}
\tag{c}
Q^*
&= \bqty{\operatorname m_a+m_X-m_b-m_{Y*}}c^2\\
&= \bqty{\operatorname m_a+m_X-m_b-m_Y-\Delta m_*}c^2\\
&= \bqty{\operatorname m_a+m_X-m_b-m_Y}c^2- E_\text{ex}\\
&= Q-E_\text{ex}\,,
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\Delta m_*$ is the additional mass due to excitation. In **\(c\)**, $Q$ represents the Q value due to the ground-state masses.
