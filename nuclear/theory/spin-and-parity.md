Spin and Parity
===============
The total angular momentum operator on the vector space formed from the tensor product of the $n$ nucleon states [can be shown](../../quantum-mechanics/angular-momentum-addition.md) to behave as an angular momentum. This angular momentum, that of the entire nucleus, is called the _nuclear spin_, represented by the symbol $I$. As an _angular momentum_, we may therefore represent the momentum state of the entire nucleus through two quantum numbers $I$ and $m$.

In ordinary magnetic fields, we can observe the _nuclear_ Zeeman effect, as the state $I$ splits into $2I+1$ equally spaced substates. If one could apply an incredibly strong magnetic field, it would be possible to see the individual $j$ splitting of each nucleon, but no such fields can be produced. Hence, we observe the nucleus as though it were a single spinning particle.

It is observed that fermions have _half-integer_ spin, and that the _orbital_ angular momentum $l$ must be integer. Thus, by the rules of angular momentum addition, nucleons must have half-integeral angular momentum $j$. Given that successive values of $I$ are separated by integer steps of $\hbar$, it follows that the nucleus has integer or half integer spin $I$, depending upon whether $A$ is odd or even, as

$$
\begin{aligned}
m_\text{nucleus} &= m_1 + m_2 + \dots + m_A\\
I_\text{max} &= m_\text{max}\,.
\end{aligned}
$$

Furthermore, it is observed that all even-$Z$ even-$N$ nuclei have spin-$0$ ground states. This provides evidence for the nuclear pairing force term in the [semi empirical mass formula](binding-energy.md#Parity), as the nucleons couple in pairs to spin $J=0$. This coupling occurs such that they occupy time-reversed spin anti-aligned orbits[^1], leaving the nuclear angular momentum $I=0$. It is this pairing energy ($\tilde1\MeV$) that leads to the first excited states of even-even nuclei being at least $1\MeV$ above the ground state, and ensures the existence of a near constant $2^+$ excited state in singly closed nuclei, caused by the recoupling of a broken nucleon pair to $2^+$.[^2]  It follows that odd-$A$ nuclei therefore must behave $I$ equal to the $j$ of the odd proton or neutron. 
In addition to nuclear spin, the [parity](../../quantum-mechanics/parity.md) is also used to label nuclear states, in the form $I^\pi$ e.g. $I^-$ or $I^+$.
