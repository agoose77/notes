Spin and Parity
===============
The total angular momentum operator on the vector space formed from the tensor product of the $n$ nucleon states [can be shown](../../quantum-mechanics/angular-momentum-addition.md) to behave as an angular momentum. This angular momentum, that of the entire nucleus, is called the _nuclear spin_, represented by the symbol $I$. As an _angular momentum_, we may therefore represent the momentum state of the entire nucleus through two quantum numbers $I$ and $m$.

In ordinary magnetic fields, we can observe the *nuclear* Zeeman effect, as the state $I$ splits into $2I+1$ equally spaced substates. If one could apply an incredibly strong magnetic field, it would be possible to see the individual $j$ splitting of each nucleon, but no such fields can be produced. Hence, we observe the nucleus as though it were a single spinning particle. 

It is observed that fermions *half-integer* spin, and that the *orbital* angular momentum $l$ must be integer. Thus, by the rules of angular momentum addition, nucleons must have half-integeral spin. Given that successive values of $I$ are separated by integer steps of $\hbar$, it therefore follows that the nucleus will have integer or half integer spin $I$, depending upon whether $A$ is odd or even, as
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_\text{nucleus} &= m_1 + m_2 + \dots + m_A\\
I_\text{max} &= m_\text{max}\,.
\end{aligned}
$$
Furthermore, it is observed that all even-$Z$ even-$N$ nuclei have spin-$0$ ground states. This provides evidence for the nuclear pairing force term in the [semi empirical mass formula](binding-energy.md#Parity), as the nucleons couple in pairs to spin-$0$, leaving $I=0$. In addition, odd-$A$ nuclei therefore must behave $I$ equal to the $j$ of the odd proton or neutron.<!-- TODO is this spin-0 SPIN or TOTAL ang-mom for the nucleons? -->
In addition to nuclear spin, the [parity](../../quantum-mechanics/parity.md) is also used to label nuclear states, in the form $I^\pi$ e.g. $I^-$ or $I^+$.  
<!-- TODO 
If the wavefunction corresponds to an eigenstate of parity, then it has _definite parity_. Hence, if all nucleons satisfy this property, and it can be shown that the wavefunctions can be multiplied to give the w.f. of the nucleus, then it follows that under parity, there will be definite even/odd parity of nucleus?
