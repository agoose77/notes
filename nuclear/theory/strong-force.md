The Strong Force
================
Ab initio, the strong (nucleon-nucleon) force *must* have the following properties:
* Short-range magnitude must exceed that of the Coulomb force (in order to overcome the Coulomb repulsion of protons within the nucleus). 
* Long-range magnitude must be negligible (such that molecules can be understood solely in terms of the Coulomb force).
* Selective interaction; some particles do not interact via the strong force, e.g. electrons.  

Additionally, it has been experimentally observed that the strong force
* Appears to be independent of whether interacting nucleons are proton-proton, neutron-neutron, or proton-neutron. Hence, the strong force must be *charge independent*.
* Depends upon the alignment of the spins (parallel, or anti-parallel).
* Possesses a short-range repulsive component, to keep nucleons at a certain average separation.
* Exhibits a noncentral (tensor) component (which thus does not conserve orbital angular momentum).  <!-- TODO link lagrangian & eul-lagrange eqns here -->
