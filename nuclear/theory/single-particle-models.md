Single Particle Models
======================
Pairing
-------
All even-even nuclei are observed to have $J^\pi=0^+$ ground states. This provides evidence for the nuclear pairing force term in the [semi empirical mass formula](binding-energy.md#Parity), as the nucleons couple in pairs to spin $J=0$. This coupling occurs such that they occupy time-reversed spin anti-aligned orbits[^krane.74], leaving the nuclear angular momentum $I=0$. It is this pairing energy ($\sim 1\MeV$ for two $J=0$ protons[^fonm.27]) that leads to the first excited states of even-even singly-closed nuclei being at least $1\MeV$ above the ground state.[^fonm.33] Frequently, even-even singly-closed nuclei have a $2^+$ first excited state due to a single broken pair of nucleons recoupling to $J^\pi=2^+$.[^fonm.33] It follows that odd-$A$ nuclei therefore must have $I$ equal to the $j$ of the odd (unpaired) proton or neutron.

In the above figure, it is evident that the overlap of nucleons in substates of different $\abs{m_l}$ is very small. Only if the nucleons have the same $\abs{m}$ does a strong interaction between both take place.[^moshe.203]

#### Spin-Orbit Potential

### Failures
#### Deformed nuclei
Nuclei which are deformed no longer possess good rotational symmtry
