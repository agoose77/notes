Nuclear Masses
==============

Mass Excess
-----------
The mass excess is the difference between the true mass and atomic number.
 $$
 \Delta = \operatorname M(\atom{A}{X}) - Am_u\,.
 $$
 It is not directly a measure of binding energy as the masses of the nucleons differ (whilst we use $\m_u$ as an average), and we do not include an electron binding contribution. $\Delta$ is *frequently used in reaction equations* where (under conservation of nucleons) the second terms ultimately sum to zero.


Mass Doublet Method
-------------------

Nuclear masses can be measured to precisions of $10^{-6}$ using a mass spectroscope. Mass spectroscopes begin with an ion source, followed by a _velocity selector_ uses the Lorentz force (with perpendicular $E$ and $B$ fields) to select for a particular ion velocity given by

$$
    qE = qvB\,,
$$

and a subsequent _momentum selector_ which employs a uniform magnetic field to bend the ion beam, with a radius $r$ determined by mass

$$
    r=\frac{mv}{qB}\,.
$$

Often the magnetic fields of the velocity and momentum selectors are common, i.e.

$$
m = \frac{qrB^2}{E}\,.
$$

Given that the precision of the mass measurement depends upon $B$ and $E$, these values must be known precisely, which in practice proves difficult. One could calibrate to a particular mass, and subsequently determine other masses by relative measurement. To measure a large range of masses however, $E$ and $B$ would need to be varied considerably, and the calibration may not remain valid to one part in $10^{-6}$ over such a range. Rather than use an absolute calibration, one can instead measure the smaller difference between two nearly equal masses, such as those given by selected molecules. Once accelerated, these molecules lose their electrons, and the molecular binding energy is of the order $10^{-9}\unit{\amu}$, thus we effectively measure only the mass of the nucleus.  
For example, one might configure the apparatus for mass $128$, and measure the difference between $\text{C}_9\text{H}_{20}$ and $\text{C}_{10}\text{H}_8$, which gives

$$
\Delta = m\mleftright{(}{\text{C}_9\text{H}_{20}}{)} - m\mleftright{(}{\text{C}_{10}\text{H}_8}{)}=12m\mleftright{(}{\atom{1}{H}}{)}-m\mleftright{(}{\atom{12}{C}}{)}\,.
$$

The technique of measuring the small difference between close lying masses is known as the _mass doublet_ method. A similar technique may be used with reaction Q values to determine nuclear masses from kinetic energy.
