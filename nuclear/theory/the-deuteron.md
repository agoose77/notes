The Dueteron
============
A deuteron $\atom{2}{H}$ is the simplest bound state of nucleons, consisting of a proton and neutron. A neutral atom of $\atom{2}{H}$ is called *deuterium*. As a weakly bound system, it has no excited states; the only excited states are unbound systems (that of a free proton and neutron).

Binding Energy
