The Dueteron
============
A deuteron $\atom{2}{H}$ is the simplest bound state of nucleons, consisting of a proton and neutron. A neutral atom of $\atom{2}{H}$ is called *deuterium*. As a weakly bound system, it has no excited states; the only excited states are unbound systems (that of a free proton and neutron).

Binding Energy
--------------
The [binding energy](binding-energy.md#Binding-Energy) of the deuteron is precisely known, using techniques such as [the mass doublet method](binding-energy.md#Mass-Doublet-Method), which gives[^1]
$$
\tag{a}
m(\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12})- m(\text{C}_6\text{D}_{6}) = (9.289710 \pm 0.000024)\times 10^{-3}\amu\,.
$$

From **(a)**, it follows that $m(\atom{2}{D}) = 2.014101789 \pm 0.000000021\amu$. The binding energy is then $$
    B = \left[m(\atom{1}{H}) + m(n)-m(\atom{2}{H})\right]c^2 = 2.22463\pm 0.0004 \MeV\,.
$$
One can also determine the binding energy by bringing together an unbound proton and neutron together to form $\atom{2}{H}$, and measuring the energy of the photon emitted (plus a recoil correction):
$$
    \atom{1}{H} + n \rightarrow \atom{2}{H} + \gamma\,.
$$
This reaction can be performed in reverse; determining the minimum photon energy required to produce deuterium (less the recoil energy).
