Resonant Scattering
===================
Resonant scattering is an experimental technique to investigate resonances in the compound nucleus formed from the beam and target nuclei. These resonances correspond to excited states which subsequently decay, forming decay products which can be measured to determine the reaction cross section as a function of excitation energy. The technique may be used to investigate $\alpha$-clustering by measuring reactions that occur via the $\alpha$ entrance channel. These reactions may be performed in normal kinematics, $\text{A}(\alpha,\text{y})\text{R}$; or in [inverse kinematics](../detectors/thick-target-inverse-kinematics.md), ${}^4\text{He}(\text{A},\text{y})\text{R}$. Where the decay product is also an $\alpha$ particle, the reaction corresponds to elastic $\alpha$-particle scattering. Such reactions explore states with an $\alpha\operatorname{-}\text{A}$ structure, as it would be anticipitated that these clustered states have a broader $\alpha$-decay width $\Gamma_\alpha$, and thus should be preferentially populated (in particular in this interaction where both the entrance and exit channels are $\alpha$).
<!-- Broader decay width as clustered alpha structure is energetically more stable, so longer lived (than what, i.d.k)). -->
