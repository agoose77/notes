Second Order Differential Equations
===================================

Consider an equation of the form
$$
    p(t)y^{\prime\prime}+q(t)y^\prime+r(t)y=g(t)\,.
$$

This is a non-homogeneous differential equation of second order. The associated _homogeneous_ equation is 
$$
    p(t)y^{\prime\prime}+q(t)y^\prime+r(t)y = 0 \,.
$$

More generally, we can show that a homogeneous linear differential equation of the form 
$$
    y^{(n)}+f_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)}+\dots + f_1(x)y^\prime + f_0(x)y = 0
$$

has $n$ linearly independent solutions $y_1,\,y_2,\,\dots,\,y_n$.
