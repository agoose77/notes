# Radiation Interactions

There are several major kinds of radiation which interact with matter, represented in the table below.

|            Charged Particulate Radiations             |                 Uncharged Radiations                  |
| :---------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
| Heavy charged particles $\sim10^{-5}\operatorname{m}$ |        Neutrons $\sim10^{-1}\operatorname{m}$         |
|     Fast electrons $\sim10^{-3}\operatorname{m}$      | X-rays \& $\gamma$ rays $\sim10^{-1}\operatorname{m}$ |

As can be seen from the table, charged radiation has a typically shorter interaction distance than that of the uncharged variety. Charged radiation interacts _continuously_ with the medium through the Coulomb force, whereas uncharged radiation must first undergo a series of discrete interactions such as collisions.
