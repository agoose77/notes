Isospin
=======
<!-- TODO: symmetry link broken-->
Isospin is a quasi-[symmetry](../../quantum-mechanics/symmetry.md) of the nuclear force, which is observed to be approximately both charge symmetric and charge independent.

### Definitions
Charge-symmetry
~ The interaction between two protons is identical to that between two neutrons. 

   
Charge-independence 
~ The proton-proton, neutron-neutron, and proton-neutron interactions are identical.

<!-- TODO: Anchor understanding of what "rotations" mean in isospin space -->

In reality, nucleon interactions with their surroundings *rarely* depend upon the absolute value of the spin axis projection, but rather its *multiplicity* (e.g. multiplicity 2 for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$). One exception to this is observed in the Stern-Gerlach experiment which employs a magnetic field to split a beam of atoms with an unpaired spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ electron into two distinct beams.
In a similar manner, due to the charge-independence of the nuclear force we rarely need to discern between a neutron and a proton, and can group them together as nucleons. Analogously to spin, however, charge independence quickly disappears in the presence of an electric field. 

This two-fold nucleon degeneracy lends itself to a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formalism, where this **isospin** $T$ may be denoted by two linearly independent vectors $T_\uparrow$ and $T_\downarrow$. 
In the context of nuclear isospin, *charge symmetry* is equivalent to requiring that the Hamiltonian remain invariant under rotations of $\pi$ radians in isospin space:
$$
     \comm{\hat{H}}{\exp(i\pi \hat{T}_3)} = 0\,.
$$
<!-- NOTE: Here a rotation about the T3 axis is used as a flip -->
*Charge independence* is a stronger statement, requiring that the Hamiltonian is invariant under*any* rotation in isospin space, and thus:
$$
    \comm{\hat{H}}{\vb{\hat{T}}} = 0\,.
$$
