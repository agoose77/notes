# The Strong Force

Ab initio, the strong (nucleon-nucleon) force _must_ have the following properties:

- Short-range magnitude must exceed that of the Coulomb force (in order to overcome the Coulomb repulsion of protons within the nucleus).
- Long-range magnitude must be negligible (such that molecules can be understood solely in terms of the Coulomb force).
- Selective interaction; some particles do not interact via the strong force, e.g. electrons.

Additionally, it has been experimentally observed that the strong force

- Appears to be independent of whether interacting nucleons are proton-proton, neutron-neutron, or proton-neutron. Hence, the strong force must be _charge independent_.
- Depends upon the alignment of the spins (parallel, or anti-parallel).
- Possesses a short-range repulsive component, to keep nucleons at a certain average separation.
- Exhibits a noncentral (tensor) component (which thus does not conserve orbital angular momentum). <!-- TODO link lagrangian & eul-lagrange eqns here -->

The force between
two nucleons must be invariant under a translation in space of the two-nucleon system
as a whole. In other words, the interaction can only depend on the relative position
of the two nucleons and not on their absolute positions with respect to some arbitrary
coordinate system. This requirement is generally referred to as translational invariance,
and it implies that only the relative coordinate between the two nucleons[^wong.76]
