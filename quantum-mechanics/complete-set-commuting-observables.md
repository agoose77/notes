Complete Set of Commuting Observables
=====================================
For a particular quantum system denoted by the vector space $V_S$, there will be a basis in terms of which all states may be defined. The set of orthogonal eigenkets $\set{\ket{a^{(1)}_i}}$ of a Hermitian operator $A_1$ will span a subspace $V_1$ of $V_S$, expressed as
$$
V_1 \subseteq V_S\,.
$$
A complete set $M$ of commuting observables (CSCO) is a set of mutually commuting observable (Hermitian) operators whose eigenvalues *uniquely define* each basis state of the system, that is 
$$
\set{\ket{a^{(1)},a^{(2)},\dots,a^{(n)}}} = V_S\,.
$$

In other words, for a CSCO there do not exist two eigenkets
$$
\begin{matrix}
\ket{\vb{p}}=\ket{a^{(1)}_p,a^{(2)}_p,\dots,a^{(n)}_p} & \ket{\vb{q}}=\ket{a^{(1)}_q,a^{(2)}_q,\dots,a^{(n)}_q}\,,
\end{matrix}
$$
such that $\ket{\vb{p}} \neq \ket{\vb{q}}$ whilst $\vb{p}=\vb{q}$, i.e. there are no degenerate eigenstates.
